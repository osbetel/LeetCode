# You are given an integer array nums and an integer target.
#
# You want to build an expression out of nums by adding one of the symbols '+' and '-' before each integer in nums and then concatenate all the integers.
#
# For example, if nums = [2, 1], you can add a '+' before 2 and a '-' before 1 and concatenate them to build the expression "+2-1".
# Return the number of different expressions that you can build, which evaluates to target.
# Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 3
# Output: 5
# Explanation: There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
# -1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
# +1 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
# +1 + 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
# +1 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 3
# +1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 3
#
# 1) recursion + memoization
# 2) table filling


def findTargetSumWays(nums, target):
    # given a target value and an array of tokens with different values,
    # can you make the target with the values in the arr?
